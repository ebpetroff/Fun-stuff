# Travel Map

Please refer to this README before using the code in this directory

Instructions for generating a visual map:
1. copy index.html to a new file at gist.github.com (name it index.html)
2. modify the airport codes and order (nb: you'll have to input each airport twice as both arrival and departure)
3. when finished, click "Create public gist"
4. copy the html link for the code (should be something like https://gist.github.com/<name>.git)
5. copy the part of the url in <name>
6. go to the url http://bl.ocks.org/<name>
